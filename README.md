The solutions for the 2 problems are here, on this repository, i will explain each one on this document.

<h3>Problem 1: REST API </h3>

<p>
For this problem the best fit was to use the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Web framework, this allows to use a clean and simple MVC structure, but also allows us to use the django toolkit called [Django - REST](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).
</p>

<p>
Django allows us to implement a MVC design pattern efficiently, by defining a model we can focus on how to handle incoming HTTP requests and even have a fully working Database. To increase the RESTfulness of the API, we use the tools offered by Django-REST, that is how we can implement the navigation logic, query filtering with query params on the URL, listing of the different models and some more advanced topics.
